# R2D2 Project

This private repository contains the final project for **ST502**, replicating and extending the analyses described in the R2D2 paper. The goal is to understand and reproduce the methodology and results of the paper using R, and to explore variations or extensions as part of the coursework.

## Project Overview

- Replicate experiments and results presented in the R2D2 paper.
- Implement the statistical models and algorithms described, primarily in R.
- Perform data preprocessing, simulation, and analysis as described in the paper.
- Provide reproducible scripts and documentation for running the analysis.

## Repository Structure

- `code/` – R scripts implementing the models, data processing, and plotting.
- `data/` – raw datasets or generated synthetic data.
- `shell/` – shell scripts or command-line utilities to run workflows.
- `reports/` – project report or notebooks summarizing findings (if included).

## Goals

- Demonstrate proficiency in statistical programming with R.
- Critically evaluate the methods and results of the R2D2 paper.
- Produce clear and reproducible code and documentation.
